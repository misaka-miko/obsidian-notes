# The team captain
**Goal**: For any positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $k \le n$
$$
n \binom{n-1}{k-1} = k\binom{n}{k}
$$
LHS:
1. choose captain first $\binom{n}{1}$
2. choose the $k-1$ members of $n-1$ people $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$

RHS:
1. choose $k$ members from $n$ people $\binom{n}{k}$
2. choose the captain from $k$ members $\binom{k}{1}$
